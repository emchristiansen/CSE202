Approximation algorithms

  * Change method -> bound "opportunity cost"
  * Achieve a bound -> Achieve a combination of bounds

Parallel job scheduling
\\( J\_i = (p\_i, d\_i), 1 \leq p\_i \leq p, 0 < d\_i \\).
P: number of processors available.
Assign each \\( J\_i \\) a time interval \\( s\_i, s\_i + d\_i), s\_i \geq 0 \\).
At any time, total processor use must be \\( \leq P \\).
Objective: Minimize makespan = max finish time.
This looks like a packing problem.

Approximate algorithm: Order the jobs from largest to smallest \\( p\_i \\).
Add the jobs to the schedule in that order.
If there are enough processors starting at the same time as the last scheduled job, make it start at the same time as the last scheduled job.
Otherwise make it start when the last scheduled job finishes.

Some lower bounds for the above solution:

  * LB1: \\( \max d\_i \\)
  * LB2: Let \\( w := \sum p\_i d\_i \\). Then a bound is \\( \frac{w}{p} \\).

Look at time last job is scheduled.
This the part of the schedule that begins at this point is at most length LB1.
Look at the schedule before this time, and call this range of time T.
At any point, at most \\( \frac{P}{2} \\) can be idle, because otherwise a job would have been scheduled in the idle block.
This holds because of the ordering on \\( p\_i \\). 
So, the work done in time 0 to T is at least \\( \frac{P}{2}T \\), which is a lower bound on W.
So \\( T \leq 2 W / P = 2 * LB2 \\).

So our solution's objective is \\( \leq 2 * LB2 + LB1 \leq 3 * OPT \\).
