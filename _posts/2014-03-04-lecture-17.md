  * Using DP for approximation algorithms
  * Network flow: Ford-Fulkerson "Hill climbing"

#Minimum makespan
Remember we can solve the problem in \\( O(n^2 A) \\) time, where \\( A := \max a\_i \\).
However, this could be exponential in the number of bits used to represent the problem (A could be large).

Given \\( a\_1, a\_2, ..., a\_n \\).
\\( \text{Sum} := \sum\_{i = 1} ^ n a\_i \\).
OPT >= Sum / 2.
\\( B = \epsilon (Sum / (2n)) \\).
Define \\( \hat{a\_i} := \lceil \frac{a\_i}{B} \rceil \leq \lceil \frac{2n}{\epsilon} \rceil \\).
You can compute the approximate solution \\( \hat{s} \\) in \\( O(n^3 / \epsilon) \\) time.

Claim:
Let loadi(s) be the load of machine i in the exact solution.
Let loadhati(s) be the load of machine i in the approximate solution.
B * loadhati - \epsilon * OPT <= loadi(s) <= B * loadhati(s).o

makespan(SHat) = max(load1(SHat), load2(SHat)) 
<= max(B loadhat1(SHat), b loadhat2 (SHat)) 
= B max(loadhat1(SHat), loadhat2(SHat))
<= B max(loadhat1(Sopt), loadhat2(Sopt))
<= max (load1(Sopt) + epsilon * OPT, load2(Sopt) + epsilon * OPT)
= OPT * (1 + epsilon)

This is called a fully polynomial time approximation scheme.

#Network flow
In network flow, you are given a directed graph with nonnegative edge weights.
The edge weights are called "capacities".
You are also given a source and sink node in the graph.
A legal flow \\( F((u, v)) \\) is a function on the edges specifying how much is flowing between any pair of nodes.
There are some laws:
Conservation: For all nodes that are not source or sink, the total flow in must equal the total flow out.
Capacity: For all edges, \\( 0 \leq F((u, v)) \leq c((u, v)) \\), where \\( c(\cdot) \\) denotes edge capacity.
\\( Flow(F) := \sum\_u F((s, u)) - F((u, s)) \\).
Objective is to maximize flow.

```
def FF(G, c, s, t):
  for every edge (u, v) in E:
    if (v, u) not in E, add it with capacity 0.
  F(e) <- 0 for every e.
  Repeat until DFS fails:
    for every e: cR(e) = c(e) - F(e) + F(eR)
    GR: set of edges with cR(e) > 0.
    Find a path from s to t in GR
    Let e in p of minimal cR(e), f <- cR(e)
    Decrease flow along eR by min(f, F(eR)) 
    increase flow long e by remaining amount f - min(f, F(eR))
```

Say F(t) is our flow after t iterations, and say c((u, v)) are integers.
Then Flow(F(t + 1)) - Flow(F(t)) >= 1.
So the algorithm terminates.
