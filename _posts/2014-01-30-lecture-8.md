Approximation algorithms

How can we analyzie greedy algorithm when they are "incorrect", i.e. don't
always find optimal Solutions?

Approximation ratio


#### Vertext Cover
* Instance: Undirected graph
* Solution space:  \\( C \leq V \\)
* Constraint: \\( \forall (u, v) \in E, u \in C\\) or \\( v \in C \\)
* Objection: minimize \\( C \\)

#### Independent Set
* Instance: Undirected graph
* Solution space:  \\( I \leq V \\)
* Constraint: \\( \forall (u, v) \in E, u \notin I\\) or \\(v \notin I \\)
* Objection: maximize \\( I \\)
* \\( I = V - C \\)

#### Stupid algorithm 
* Pick \\(e \in E\\), \\(e = (u, v)\\)
* Put both \\(u, v\\) from \\(G\\)
* Repeat until no edges left
* There is no algorithm that is better than this stupid one in the worst case

#### Bound argument:
* Let \\(e\_1, e\_2, ... , e\_k \\) be the edges our algorithm picks (matching
  in G)
* Any cover \\(C'\\) must contains \\( \geq 1\\) node from every \\(e\_i, |C'|
  \geq K \\), our cover \\(C\\), \\(|C| = 2K \leq 2|C'|\\)
* If \\( C' \\) is an optimal cover, our cover is \\( \leq 2 \times OPT \\)

* \\(A(I)\\)
* A has approximation ratio \\(\rho\\) if 
* \\(\forall I, Cost(A(I)) \leq \rho Cost(Opt(I))\\)

* Define \\(LB(I)\\)
* Lemma: \\(\forall S, Cost(S) \geq LB(I)\\)
* Lemma \\(Cost(A(I)) \leq \rho LB[i]\\)
* \\(LB\_1, LB\_2, .. LB\_k \\)
* \\(Cost(A[i]) \leq \rho\_1LB\_1 + \rho\_2LB\_2 + ... + \rho\_kLB\_k \\)
* \\(\rho = \rho\_1 + \rho\_2 + .. + \rho\_k \\)

### metric TSP (Travelling salesman problem)
* \\(Cost(TSP) \geq MST\\)
* \\(Cost(ourTour) \leq Cost(InOrderTraversal) = 2MST \leq 2Cost(TSP) \leq
  2Cost(TSP)\\)
* \\( Cost(ChristoPhides) \leq MST + min(wtMatching) \\)
* \\(Cost(TSP) \geq  2 Min(wtMatching) \\)

### back to vertext cover
* Let \\(C\_0\\) be any optimal cover.
* \\(e\_1 = (u, v)\\) be the first edge over algorithm picks,
* There is a cover \\(C\\), that \\(u, v \in C\_1 and |C\_1| \leq |C\_0| + 1\\)
* Opportunity cost decision Cost(best solution that agrees desition) - Cost(best
  solution) (= 0) (?)

* Lset \\(C\_0\\) be any optimal cover, \\(e\_1 = (u, v)\\) be the first edge over
  algorithm pick. There is a cover \\(C\_1\\) that 
  \\(u, v \in C\_1 and |C\_1| \leq |C\_0| + 1\\)
 
* By strong induction proof,
* \\( C = (u, v) + ourCover(G - (u, v)) \\)
* \\( C\_1 = (u, v) + someCover(G - (u, v)) \\)
* \\(|C| = 2 + |ourCover(G - (u,v)) \leq
  2 + 2 |C\_1 - (u, v)| = 
  2 + 2(|C\_1 - 2|) = 2|C\_1| - 2 =
  2(|C| + 1) - 2 = 2|C\_0| \\)

#### Interval scheduling
* Schedule shortest event in the 1st available room,
* if any , .. SDF
* \\(Sched\_0'\\): optimal schedule
* \\(Sched\_i'\\): sched that agrees alg picks w? SDF on 1st i decisions.
* \\(Claims: |Sched'| - |Sched\_{i+1}'| \leq ? \\)
* \\(I\_{i+1}\\) is the smallest duration of any interval that doesn't intersect
  with previous schedule interval, Any events that intersect with \\(I\_{i+1}\\)
  in \\(Sched\_i'\\) must have \\(\leq\\) large durations
* \\(Sched\_{i+1}' = Sched\_i' \bigcup (I\_{i+1}~in~SDF~room) -\\) (all
  conflicting events in room)
* \\(|Sched\_i'| \leq |Sched\_0'| - i\\)
* Let \\(k\\) be the # of interval in SDF, \\(Sched\_k'\\), but no internals
  left when SDF terminates 
* so, \\(Sched\_k' = SDF \\)
* \\(k = |SDF| = |Sched\_k'| \geq |Sched\_0| - k\\)
* So, \\( 2 \times k = 2|SDF| \geq |Sched\_0'|\\)
* \\(k \geq 1/2 |Sched\_0'| = 1/2 |OPT|\\)
* Greedy is optimal. There is no opportunity cost
* Greedy approximation analysis: The opportunity cost \\(\leq\\)
  (some multiple of our immediate gain)
