  * Divide and conquer
    * Selection - derandomization (Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, Tarjan)
  * Back-tracking
    * Improved exponential time algorithms
    * 1/2 of DP

In QuickSelect, the rank of a good pivot in the sorted list is betweeen \\( \alpha n \\) and \\( (1 - \alpha) n \\), where there are \\( n \\) elements.
The hope of the derandomized technique is to find a pivot that is "almost media" in linear time.

Consider breaking the \\( n \\) elements into \\( m \\) groups of size \\( n / m \\).
Take the median in every group, then the median of the medians.
If you take \\( m = \sqrt{n} \\), you get an \\( O(n \log \log n) \\) technique.
If you take \\( m = \log{n} \\), you get an \\( O(n \log ^* n) \\) technique.
The trick is to take \\( m = n / 5 \\), or an other odd larger than 3.
\\( n / 10 \\) of the group medians are less than our pivot.
3 elements of each such group are smaller than our pivot, so there are \\( 3n/10 \\) elements smaller than our pivot.
Applying a symmetric argument for the larger elements, we can get \\( \alpha = 0.3 \\).
Then we can use the same analysis as last time to get an \\( O(n) \\) algorithm.
The recurrence looks like
\\[
T(n) = T(n/5) + T(.7 n) + O(n)
\\]

#Backtracking
A general approach to solving constrained optimization problems.
Unfortunately, this algorithm usually gives you an exponential algorithm.
Fortunately, the exponential is usually better than naive exhaustive search.

##Independent Set
Find the maximum subset of the vertices of a graph such that no two nodes are adjacent.

Exhaustive search would take \\( O(2^n poly(n)) \\) time.
With backtracking, we can prune branches that are inconsistent, sub-optimal, or redundant.
