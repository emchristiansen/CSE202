  * NP-completeness
  * Independent set is NP-complete
  * What to do when your problem is NP-complete

Want to show Independent Set is NP-complete by reducing Circuit SAT to it.

#Circuit SAT
Inputs \\( x\_1, ..., x\_n \\) and \\( g\_{n+1}, ..., g\_{m} \\) other gates such that \\( g\_i = OP\_i(g\_j, g\_k) \\), \\(j, k < i \\).
Determine whether there is an assignment to \\( x\_i \\) such that \\( g\_m = 1 \\).

#Independent Set
Instance: \\( G, 1 \leq k \leq |V| \\).
Solution: \\( I \subseteq V \\)
Constraints: \\( \forall u, v \in I \\) we have \\( {u, v} \notin E \\) and \\( |I| = k \\).

For each gate \\( g\_i \\) insert two nodes \\( A\_i \\) and \\( B\_i \\) in graph.
\\( A\_i \in I \iff g\_i  = 1 \\) and \\( B\_i \in I \iff g\_i  = 0 \\).
For the computation, will create gates \\( C\_i, D\_i, E\_i, F\_i \\).
These correspond to each of the 4 possible values of inputs to the gate.
Russell drew a diagram on the board showing how a gate from Circuit SAT can be represented as graph in the Independent Set paradigm.

#Dealing with NP-complete problems

  * Ask "Is this really my problem?".
    * Am I defining my problem in too-general a way?
  * Maybe improved exponential time is good enough and you can use a 3-SAT solver.
    * Reductions to 3-SAT tend to be fairly parsimonious.
  * Try to find an approximation algorithm.
  * Average-case analysis.
  * Smoothed analysis
  * Heuristics
