#Fibonacci Heap

A fib heap is a _variable_ degree tree with heap ordering on keys. 
It adjusts degree of trees in a graph on the fly. 
Each parent can have multiple children, but only pointers to the first and last are stored. 
The children are arranged in a double linked list with pointers to siblings. 
Fib heaps have a \underline{set} of connectivity trees; the fib heap data structure is an array of trees where each element is a root in a connectivity tree.

##Notation 
At a node \\( x \\)

  * pointer parent: \\( p(x) \\)
  * sibling pointers: \\( ls(x), rs(x) \\)
  * first and last child pointer: \\( fc(x), lc(x) \\)
  * key: \\( key(x) \\)
  * degree (\# of children): \\( d(x) \\)
  * mark: \\( m(x) \\), boolean value
  * other fields: e.g. node names

#Potential function
We use the idea of amortized analysis from last lecture and define the potential function as
\\[
\phi := \alpha N\_F + \beta N\_M 
\\]
where \\( N\_F \\) is the number of filled positions in the array and \\( N_M \\) is the number of marked nodes.

Amortized cost is total cost plus a difference in the potential function: 
\\[
A\_{op\_i} = T\_{op\_i} + (\phi\_i - \phi\_{i-1}).
\\]


##Operations on Fib Heap
###Decreasing key
Decreasing the key of a node is easier than in a min heap because we are able to move the node out of its current tree and move it to a place in the array. Thus, decreasing the key does not affect any other nodes.

```python
// Pseudocode for decreaseKey(u).
def decreaseKey(u):
  Snip u out of current tree.
  if (p(u) is marked):
    // Cascade moving marked nodes to top.
    Recursively move p(u) to top.
  if (p(u) is not marked):
    Mark p(u).
  Move u to array at index d(u).
  Make larger key child of smaller key.
  Increase degree of smaller key by one.
  Move merged tree into next location.
  Unmark nodes at top.
```

####Time cost for decreasing key
\\[
A\_{DK} = c\_2 + c\_3 N\_{CM} + (c\_1 + c) N\_M - \beta N\_M + \beta = c\_2
\\]
Where \\( N\_{CM} \\) is the number of consecutive marks along path to root. 
Pick \\( \beta = c\_3 + (c\_1 + c) \\). 
The last \\( \beta \\) addition is for marking the root. 
Total time for decreasing keys is constant \\( O(1) \\).

####Moving and Cascade Merging
We only move nodes if it is marked (see below) and the node, \\( u \\), is moved into the array position that corresponds to the degree of \\( u \\). 
If there are multiple roots that have the same degree then merge. 
The merged tree will have a larger degree and be moved to a new corresponding position in the array. 
This leads to "cascading merges".

####Marking nodes
When nodes are moved to the top, we unmark it. 
If a node is marked, merge its parent (recursively) .
If a node is un-marked, mark it.

####Time cost for cascading merges
Pick \\( \alpha = c \\) to get constant amortized time. 
Since merging doesn't change the number of marks, don't care about setting \\( \beta \\).
\\[
A\_{CM} = c N\_M + c\_1 - \alpha (N\_M - 1) = c\_1 + \alpha \in O(1).
\\]

####Delete minimum
Delete the minimum and insert a child into the array with cascading merges, with \\( O(1) \\) cost for each merge. 
Total time complexity is \\( O(deg(u)) \\).

##Why called Fibonacci heap?
_Lemma_: If top node of tree \\( T \\) has degree \\( d \\), then \\( size(T) \\) is at least \\( fib\_{d-1} \\).

We want to show that degree of \\( T \\) is small as a function of number of vertices, \\( n \\). 
The size of the tree is exponentially large as a function of \\( d \\) at the top.
